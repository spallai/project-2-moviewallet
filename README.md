This is the ReadMe file for Movie Wallet, the tumbler/tinder reimagination for movie trailers. Now you get to sort through movie suggestions via fun trailers, remember them for rainy days, and all with a quick click of a button. 

Sign Up or Log In, go straight to your feed and use the controllers to sort if the movie needs to go to your yes, no, or maybe wallets. Click on the info button to get more information on your trailer interest.

Proceed to your wallets to look at the libraries you have created for yourselves.
